# Cardiovascular-Disease-Dataset
This repository contains project materials for the Winter STAT 232 class, University of California, Riverside, A. Gary Anderson School of Management. 

## Introduction
For those who are new to this folder, the `Project-Code.Rmd`, `Project-Code.html`, and `Project-Code.Rproj` files are our main coding files. This project is completed using R Markdown in R Studio. The data is originally obtained from Kaggle.com, link will be attached below. Feel free to explore more options beyond this analysis report.

### Project Idea


## Contents
- **`Project-Code.Rmd`**: This contains the R Markdown code which contains most of our analysis coding.
- **`Project-Code.html`**: HTML export of the Jupyter Notebook for easy reading.
- **`Final-Report.docs`**: Documents which reports our finding and analysis during the project.
- **`Data Folder`**: Contains the datasets used for analysis. This dataset is uploaded by Bhavik Jikadara. **Disclaimer**: The data is obtained from Kaggle.com [Loan Status Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/loan-status-prediction/code) published by City of Los Angeles. All data are used for educational purposes only. Do not republish Jikadara's work without approval. License: Data files are copyrighted by the original authors

## Note for Reader
In the final part of the `Project-Code.ipynb`, I tried to re-run the Jupyter Notebook and encountered problems. However, for analysis purposes, we already imported the results from Jupyter Notebook to the `Final-Report.docs`, check here for detailed analysis.
