# Cardiovascular-Disease-Dataset
This repository contains project materials for the Winter STAT 232 class, University of California, Riverside, A. Gary Anderson School of Management. 

## Introduction
For those who are new to this folder, the `Project-Code.Rmd`, `Project-Code.html`, and `Project-Code.Rproj` files are our main coding files. This project is completed using R Markdown in R Studio. The data is originally obtained from Kaggle.com, link will be attached below. Feel free to explore more options beyond this analysis report.

### Project Idea
This project focuses on analyzing a cardiovascular disease dataset to develop predictive models that can identify individuals at risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. Using various data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to uncover significant patterns and risk factors associated with cardiovascular conditions. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and model training and evaluation. The ultimate goal is to create a reliable prediction model that can aid healthcare providers in early detection and prevention of cardiovascular diseases, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes and public health strategies.
